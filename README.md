# 📝 BlogSphere – A React + JS In-Memory Blogging App

A multi-page blog application built using **React (frontend)** and **JavaScript (backend logic with data structures)**. No database is used — all functionality relies on **in-memory storage** via JavaScript objects and arrays. Users can register, log in, post blogs (with images), like others' posts, and even send & accept friend requests.

## ✨ Features

- 🧑‍💻 User registration & login using hashmaps (no database)
- 🖼️ Create blog posts with image uploads and text
- ❤️ Like posts
- 👥 Send and accept friend requests
